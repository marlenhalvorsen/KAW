# KAW – North Jutlandic Dictionary of *kaw’e* Expressions  

**KAW** is a word from the North Jutland dialect. It describes something difficult, heavy, or a bit troublesome – e.g., *a kaw case*.  

This project is a **practice playground** where I explore software architecture and coding patterns, while also having fun with North Jutlandic expressions.  

## Purpose  
I use the project as a learning ground to:  
- Revisit C# fundamentals  
- Work with layered architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure)  
- Apply SOLID principles in practice  
- Develop iteratively: starting as a console app, later evolving into a Web API (and possibly a frontend)  
- Ensure quality with testing (using Moq, among others)  

## Status  
- [x] Basic structure (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Console)  
- [x] Console menu for adding and displaying expressions  
- [x] Repository implementation (in-memory)  
- [ ] EF Core integration  
- [ ] API endpoints  
- [ ] Frontend (planned)  

## About the Project  
This is **not a finished product** but an ongoing process.  
It demonstrates how I practice core C# skills, experiment with layered architecture, and gradually extend the solution step by step.
